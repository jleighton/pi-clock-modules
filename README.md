# pi-clock-modules
See https://github.com/thearduinoguy/PiClock

This project aims to create 'modules' that can be used to add functionality to the clock at my local hackspace. Eventually, I plan to build a similar clock, so these are somewhat biased towards integrations and APIs that I would use myself.

## time-date.py	
Shows the date and time
## dark-sky.py	
Shows the current weather for a location. Requires darksky API key: https://darksky.net/dev
## date-fact.py	
Uses http://numbersapi.com/ to generate a fact of the day
## untappd.py
Shows your most recent untapped checkin. Requires untapped API key: https://untappd.com/api/docs
