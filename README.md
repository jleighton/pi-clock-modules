# pi-clock-modules
See https://github.com/thearduinoguy/PiClock

This project aims to create 'modules' that can be used to add functionality to the clock at my local hackspace. Eventually, I plan to build a similar clock, so these are somewhat biased towards integrations and APIs that I would use myself.
